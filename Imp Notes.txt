##1. What is Node js ?
--> Its Open Source Server Enviornment and Usees Java Script on Server.


**Node js uses Asynchronus programming : Because it eliminates the waiting time , and continuous with next request.
**It runs single threaded , non blocking and is memory efficient.

##How node js works:
1. send the task to computer file system.
2. Ready to Handle next request
3. When file system has opened file and read it , server will send content to client.

##What it can Do --> 
1.read, write, delete , and close files in server. also can generate dynamic pages.
2.add, delete , modify data into database.

##what is node.js file??
--> it contains Task which are generated on the specific event	.
--> node.js must be initiated on the server before having any effect.


##What are modules in node js ??
--> We can consider modules same as the javascript libraries , or a set of functions you want to include in your application.

##Some built in modules in nodejs are :
http : to serve nodejs as http server
path : to habdle the file path
More ex. : https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/ref_modules.asp


##How to include the module :
we can use require function to include the module 
--> For ex : var httpserver = require('http');

##How to Create Our Own Modules :

For eg : Creating the Module which return current date and time of system
--  exports.myDateTime = function(){
    return Date();      //Date is the Inbuilt Function in nodejs
}

//exports is used becuase we have to access this module outside into the other fiiles or module file.



##Built In HTTP module :
node.js has bulit in module called HTTP , which allows node.js to tranfer data over HTTP server protocol. To inlcude MOdule use require().
For Eg : var a = require('http');


##To use Node.js As a web Server :
The HTTP module can create an HTTP server that listens to server ports and give response back to client.
For this we can usee the Create Server Method ; createServer();


## TO Add the HTTP Header :
If the Response from the sever suposed to displayed in HTML , We should Include HTTP header with correct Content Type.
For Eg : res.writeHead(200,{'content-Type' : 'Text/html'});

req : parameter is parameter that the client has requested to the server . It include the property called URL which gives the URL name after Domain Name.

##Split the Quesry From URL Side:
THere are inbulit module to split the query string from URL that is URL module so we would be requiring that module.


##Node Js As File Server:
The nodejs file system allows us to work with the file system on our computer.
To import module we have to use the require();
for eg : var fs = require('fs');

##Commom Use Of file Syatems : 
1. read , write , create , update , delete , rename 

1. To read The files in Node js : fs.readFile() to read file from computer 
We would do example which would re reading HTML File from Computer System as example.

2. To create the File using node js :
    fs.appendFile(); - to wrtite after the content already exist , if file not exist it will create it and the wtrite to file
    fs.open(); - to open file in write or empty mode depend on the flag in the parameter.
    fs.writeFile(); - to write the content into the file and replaced the previous content if already exists.

3. To delte the File From Comnputer Using nodejs use :
    fs.unlink();

4. to rename the file : 
    fs.rename();  //@params : initial File name , file name to be rename , function of error handling


##Bulit In URL Module (Advanced Topics):
--- url.parse() : - Parse an address with the url.parse() method.  and will return URL object with each part of the Address Properties
Demo is availabe ib  Demo_URLModule.js  
Some Function in URL are : Pathname , host and search


##Node.js NPM :
Npm is package manager for the modules for node.js packages

##What is Package??
-- A package in node.js is conatins all the files you need for the mpodule.
Modules are javascript libraries we can include in our project.

## TO Download a Package From NPM:
npm install 'upper-case'  -- name of the package is in the single qoutes , we have to wtrite command without qotes.

## How to use the NPM pacakges :
we can use same as we were using modules , by using the require() method.
For Eg : Dem_npm_upper_case.js is the Demo File


##Node.js Events:
--Every action on a computer is like the event , like connection is made or file is opened
--objects in nodejs can fire the events , like readstream objects fires event whern opening and closing file;
eg is shown in Demo_events_read_openFile.js

##Event Module in Nodejs inbuilt Functions :
--node js has inbuluit event where we can create , fire and listen for -your events
-- all event Properties and method are an instance of an EventEmitter object. To be able to access the properties and methods 
we have to create EventEmitter object.
We can see the example in file Demo_Event_Emmoiter_Object.js file.

##Node Js To upload the File in the server:

The Formidable Module is required to doing the Uploading of the Files 
the example of the upload is in the file Demo_formidable.js
--In this file we would be uploading the file from the computer system in node.js


##Node Js sending the mail using nodemailer module:
--this module makes easy toi send the mail from the computer.
--How to send the email is shown in thew example of file : Demo_nodeMailer.js

##Node Js Connecting With Mysql::
-->To connect with the mysql we have to require to download mysql module from npm and require in our node.js file

After require the module we haver to connect with the database.
to connect with it we use createConnection() function shown in Demo_Mysql_connection.

##After this as we have connected to the Database we can start now querying from nodejs to mysql.
con.query(sql,function(err,result)); --> Function tajes two aeguemnts as parameter
@param1 : sql variable in which the query is written
@param2 : function with error and result handling , if perfectly executed query result will store in 'result' else err will throw error.


##How to create the Database using Node.js:
we have to fire the sql query for the same to create database in con.query function;

##How to Create the Table using the NODEjs :
we have to fire the query for same in the con.query function as parameter.
demo is shown in Demo_createTable.js

##How to Create Primary while Creating the Table :
Eg Demo shhown in Demo_primary_Key_table.js

##How to insert the values into the table.
Foir that we have to fire the query for insert shown in example Demo_insertquery.js

---What if we want to insert multiple records at same time??
-- for that we can use array and pass to the sql statement how?? see example Demo_insertquery.js
--to insert more than one record make an array conatining of the records and insert a question mark at last of the sql query
just like sql_query="INSERT INTO (name ,address) customers VALUES ?";
on executiong the query at run time question mark would be replaced by the array values;
how to do : con.query(sql,[values],function(err,result){
    console.log(result.affectedRows);       //it would return the how many rows inserted
});
